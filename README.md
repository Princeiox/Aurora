
# 🍃 Aurora
 
> The friendliest programming language for data-driven dreamers.
 
Aurora is designed from the ground up to be **beginner-friendly**, **readable**, and **powerful**. It strips away the clutter of traditional syntax (semicolons, braces) and replaces them with clean keywords and structure.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/aurora.git
cd aurora
```

### Running a Program
Run the "Hello World" example:
```bash
python -m source.aurora run examples/hello.aurora
```
*(Make sure to set PYTHONPATH if needed)*

### The Playground
Open `playground/index.html` in your browser to try Aurora instantly!

### VS Code Extension
Copy the `tools/vscode_extension` folder to your `.vscode/extensions` directory to get syntax highlighting and snippets.
